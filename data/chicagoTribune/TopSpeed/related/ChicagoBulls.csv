Its, impossible, to, miss, Dalen, Terry, on, the, sidelines, of, a, Chicago, Bulls, game, On, the, bench, with, his, hoodie, zipped, to, his, chin, and, pulled, over, his, head, Terry, often, resembles, an, overenergetic, little, brother, at, an, AAU, game, He, leaps, on, top, of, teammates, wobbles, his, knees, through, dance, choreographies, and, at, one, point, pretended, to, stomp, on, miniature, versions, of, the, opponent, But, while, Terry, has, been, the, star, performer, of, the, Bulls, bench, the, rookie, is, barely, cracking, the, lineup, averaging, only, 33, minutes, of, mopup, time, through, the, first, quarter, of, his, debut, NBA, season, As, Terry, heads, back, to, the, Windy, City, Bulls, for, another, GLeague, stint, its, unclear, when, the, Bulls, will, take, a, chance, on, bringing, their, firstround, draft, pick, into, the, rotation, While, coach, Billy, Donovan, emphasized, his, belief, in, the, rookies, future, he, feels, Terry, still, isnt, ready, for, meaningful, minutes, If, you, throw, him, in, the, rotation, youve, got, to, sit, somebody, else, Donovan, said, Right, now, I, dont, think, hes, at, the, level, of, some, of, our, guys, I, love, his, competitiveness, but, theres, also, things, hes, going, to, continue, to, grow, at, and, get, better, at, that, are, not, quite, there, yet, Even, in, practice, Donovan, describes, Terrys, presence, on, the, court, as, a, constant, rush, The, Bulls, drafted, Terry, for, his, frenetic, pace, on, the, court, creating, chaos, as, a, pickpocket, defender, and, elite, passer, for, the, Arizona, Wildcats, through, two, NCAA, seasons, That, frantic, energy, was, visible, from, Terrys, first, seconds, on, an, NBA, court, a, thirdquarter, substitution, in, the, first, preseason, game, against, the, New, Orleans, Pelicans, Terry, immediately, sized, up, Pelicans, guard, Devonte, Graham, hands, twitching, and, feet, skittering, as, he, battled, to, stay, in, front, of, the, veteran, ball, handler, That, brief, defensive, series, showcased, Terrys, promise, as, a, oneonone, defender, It, also, ended, in, a, foul, as, Terry, overeager, perhaps, to, a, fault, bumped, Graham, on, his, way, to, the, basket, Donovan, said, this, is, the, challenge, for, Terry, in, a, nutshell, while, the, rookie, shows, flashes, of, skill, hes, still, making, too, many, mistakes, to, reliably, factor, into, the, Bulls, rotation, The, game, just, has, to, slow, down, Donovan, said, Hes, got, a, really, really, good, energy, and, hes, got, a, good, motor, but, things, have, got, to, slow, down, for, him, a, little, bit, in, terms, of, reading, screens, and, making, decisions, He, innately, is, a, very, very, good, passer, but, even, in, practice, you, can, tell, theres, things, defensively, where, he, just, doesnt, have, enough, under, his, belt, For, a, defensefirst, player, like, Terry, mistakes, are, part, of, the, learning, process, Becoming, an, elite, NBA, defender, means, learning, how, to, gamble, how, to, time, a, jump, into, the, passing, lane, when, to, swipe, down, at, a, slightly, errant, dribble, which, players, need, to, be, followed, through, every, single, screen, While, Donovan, encourages, this, trialanderror, as, a, vital, portion, of, Terrys, learning, process, he, also, feels, the, Bulls, cant, afford, the, risk, of, relying, on, his, inexperience, Hes, really, really, reliable, in, a, lot, of, situations, and, listen, young, guys, are, going, to, make, mistakes, Donovan, said, I, get, that, Thats, part, of, the, game, So, Im, not, trying, to, be, overly, critical, that, hes, making, mistakes, or, he, shouldnt, do, that, But, at, the, same, point, for, him, I, think, that, the, speed, and, pace, of, the, game, for, him, mentally, needs, to, slow, down, While, he, could, offer, a, boost, to, the, defensive, energy, Terry, isnt, a, solution, to, one, of, the, Bulls, most, pressing, issues, 3point, shooting, Terry, averaged, only, 19, attempts, from, behind, the, arc, in, college, After, he, was, drafted, he, acknowledged, the, work, necessary, to, bring, his, shot, up, to, an, NBA, level, Even, at, the, GLeague, level, Terry, shot, 182, from, 3point, range, during, his, five, games, with, Windy, City, Terry, will, never, be, the, sharpshooter, the, Bulls, need, but, once, hes, ready, for, the, big, leagues, hell, provide, plenty, in, the, way, of, defense, ball, movement, and, highmotor, energy, The, fact, that, this, is, the, MO, for, too, many, players, on, the, Bulls, roster, is, a, separate, issue, for, a, separate, article, The, rest, of, Terrys, rookie, season, will, be, a, balancing, act, for, the, Bulls, who, hope, to, keep, feeding, Terry, minutes, in, the, GLeague, while, keeping, him, with, the, first, team, for, games, and, travel, And, although, it, hasnt, come, yet, Donovan, emphasized, that, the, Bulls, are, eager, to, bring, Terry, in, at, the, right, moment, I, dont, think, its, any, question, I, believe, he, can, get, there, Donovan, said,
