authorized, the, settlement, In, advocating, for, the, 15, million, award, she, also, pointed, out, The, accident, involved, the, Chicago, police, officer, himself, it, was, not, the, offender, that,

parts, of, which, were, broadcast, live, on, TV, after, being, spotted, by, a, cameraequipped, helicopter, began, with, a, first, police, chase, on, the, South, Side, A, stolen, black, Jeep, linked, to, multiple, shootings, and, a, homicide, was, spotted, there, before, it, headed, north, on, the, Dan, Ryan, Expressway, from, 95th, Street, Illinois, State, Police, and, Chicago, police, took, turns, pursuing, it, as, it, headed, north, at, times, speeding, beyond, 110, mph, Ruether, said, Chicago, police, supervisors, ordered, officers, to, stop, chasing, the, Jeep, while, state, troopers, took, over, and, the, Jeep, crashed, by, the, Kennedy, Expressways, Irving, Park, Road, exit, where, the, driver, was, taken, into, custody, But, alleged, passenger, Marcel, Oliver, 22, sprinted, out, to, a, gas, station, at, Irving, Park, and, North, Pulaski, Road, where, Ruether, said, he, carjacked, the, driver, of, a, silver, Nissan, Rogue, The, officer, who, later, crashed, into, FranciscoMartinez, was, sitting, nearby, in, his, marked, police, car, with, his, partner, Ruether, said, He, turned, on, the, emergency, lights, and, siren, and, pursued, the, suspect, 32, miles, down, Irving, Park, to, Ashland, with, both, of, them, driving, on, the, wrong, side, the, street, when, near, a, construction, site, As, the, two, vehicles, approached, the, intersection, the, silver, Nissan, blew, past, the, red, light, Ruether, said, So, did, the, police, vehicle, but, it, struck, FranciscoMartinez, who, was, heading, north, on, Ashland, and, had, a, green, light, with, great, force, Ruether, said, The, police, car, was, traveling, 101, mph, right, before, the, crash, and, 89, mph, at, the, time, of, impact, Ruether, said, FranciscoMartinez, was, driving, 20, to, 27, mph, FranciscoMartinez, was, extricated, from, her, car, and, died, in, the, hospital, during, surgery, Oliver, was, arrested, about, 20, minutes, later, and, charged, with, firstdegree, murder, vehicular, hijacking, possession, of, a, stolen, motor, vehicle, and, other, charges, in, connection, with, the, chase, and, crash, Ruether, noted, that, depending, on, the, verdict, in, the, criminal, case, against, Oliver, he, could, be, financially, liable, but, hes, not, going, to, be, able, to, pay, any, amount, of, it, Thats, just, the, reality, of, the, situation, The, day, after, the, crash, city, leaders, offered, few, details, while, also, vowing, a, review, of, police, pursuit, policies, Mayor, Lori, Lightfoot, said, shed, become, very, concerned, about, police, pursuits, since, taking, office, and, that, a, new, policy, and, training, plan, were, forthcoming, The, frequency, of, them, that, they, cause, death, they, cause, injury, they, cause, property, damage, the, whole, works, she, said, about, the, chases, Two, months, later, the, department, issued, an, updated, policy, that, introduced, additional, restrictions, and, paperwork, in, those, situations, including, requiring, the, officer, check, for, traffic, before, driving, through, an, intersection, It, also, upheld, the, balancing, test, introduced, a, year, earlier, which, calls, for, officers, to, evaluate, whether, the, need, to, apprehend, a, fleeing, suspect, outweighs, the, inherent, danger, created, by, a, motor, vehicle, pursuit, Stressing, an, officer, will, never, be, disciplined, for, ending, a, vehicle, chase, the, revised, code, said, It, is, the, Chicago, Police, Departments, goal, to, ensure, department, members, consider, the, need, for, immediate, apprehension, of, an, eluding, suspect, and, the, requirement, to, protect, the, public, from, the, danger, created, by, eluding, offenders, In, the, crash, thats, the, subject, of, the, settlement, both, pursuits, were, indeed, for, very, serious, offenses, Ruether, said, but, it, was, unlikely, a, jury, would, find, that, the, need, to, apprehend, the, suspect, outweighed, the, risk, of, speeding, down, Irving, Park, Road, at, that, rate, Ruether, also, shed, some, light, on, FranciscoMartinezs, last, months, First, she, lived, in, Rockford, working, the, night, shift, at, a, factory, and, then, dropping,
