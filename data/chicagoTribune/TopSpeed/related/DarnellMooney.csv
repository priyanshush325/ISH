Mooney, will, meet, with, his, doctor, again, to, confirm, his, next, steps, Mooney, was, blocking, on, a, David, Montgomery, run, in, the, third, quarter, at, MetLife, Stadium, when, Jets, safety, Jordan, Whitehead, landed, on, Mooneys, left, leg, causing, it, to, bend, awkwardly, Bears, staff, had, to, help, Mooney, off, the, field, and, to, the, tunnel, because, he, couldnt, put, weight, on, his, leg, The, injury, leaves, the, Bears, without, one, of, their, most, important, players, as, they, try, to, make, strides, in, their, stillquiet, passing, game, Mooney, was, one, of, secondyear, quarterback, Justin, Fields, favorite, targets, the, last, two, years, and, did, extra, work, with, Fields, during, the, offseason, in, Atlanta, and, after, practices, The, 2020, fifthround, pick, out, of, Tulane, had, 81, catches, for, 1055, yards, and, four, touchdowns, last, season, He, had, 40, catches, for, 493, yards, and, two, touchdowns, this, year, Once, we, got, going, into, the, offense, he, really, started, to, shine, Eberflus, said, Outstanding, at, blocking, the, perimeter, He, had, a, really, nice, connection, with, Justin, throughout, that, stretch, He, is, our, leading, receiver, But, more, importantly, he, is, a, great, teammate, Hes, a, great, leader, No, one, puts, more, yards, in, than, Darnell, Mooney, Ill, promise, you, that, He, laps, people, He, doubles, them, up, Mooney, had, at, least, one, catch, in, 44, straight, regularseason, games, before, Sunday, He, sat, out, the, Bears, playoff, game, in, the, 2020, season, with, an, ankle, injury, the, only, game, he, has, missed, He, has, become, known, as, a, quiet, leader, at, Halas, Hall, respected, by, coaches, and, teammates, for, the, way, he, works, His, attitude, you, feel, it, in, the, building, tight, end, Cole, Kmet, said, He, brings, light, in, the, room, a, great, leader, a, dude, that, everyone, seems, to, gravitate, toward, So, whenever, you, lose, a, guy, like, that, in, the, huddle, its, definitely, tough, for, the, team, Obviously, hes, a, great, playmaker, but, just, his, attitude, and, how, he, approaches, his, day, to, day, is, really, special, As, the, offense, has, gone, through, the, running, game, this, year, behind, Fields, Montgomery, and, nowinjured, Khalil, Herbert, the, Bears, dont, have, another, wide, receiver, with, more, than, 14, catches, Kmet, has,

yards, The, Bears, are, last, in, the, NFL, with, 1312, passing, yards, per, game, Mooneys, injury, could, make, it, more, challenging, for, Fields, to, improve, in, the, passing, game, when, he, returns, from, the, separated, left, shoulder, that, kept, him, out, Sunday, Claypool, at, least, has, seen, his, playing, time, steadily, rise, as, he, gets, more, comfortable, in, the, offense, after, arriving, via, trade, earlier, this, month, though, he, was, banged, up, in, Sundays, game, too, When, asked, Sunday, what, the, Bears, would, miss, without, Mooney, quarterback, Trevor,

attitude, toward, this, Kmet, said, Hes, going, to, take, this, head, on, and, hes, going, to, work, his, tail, off, And, I, know, hes, going, to, have, a, big, comeback, for, sure, Eberflus, didnt, have, an, update, on, safety, Eddie, Jackson, who, suffered, a, foot, injury, Sunday, He, said, the, Bears, didnt, know, yet, whether, it, was, seasonending, Were, going, to, find, out, with, Eddie,

to, tackle, but, Eberflus, said, Were, pretty, comfortable, with, him, playing, guard, Eberflus, called, Claypool, and, St, Brown, day, to, day, after, they, had, undisclosed, issues, Sunday,
