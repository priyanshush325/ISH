Hobarts, Noah, Ehrlich, says, he, was, disappointed, with, his, high, school, debut, Seriously, After, a, freshman, season, for, the, Regions, most, decorated, program, in, which, he, completed, 120, of, 188, passes, for, 1813, yards, with, 16, touchdowns, and, one, interception, I, thought, I, couldve, done, better, mentally, Ehrlich, said, IQwise, I, think, Im, a, lot, stronger, this, year, Im, really, excited, to, pick, apart, defenses, this, year, I, have, higher, expectations, for, sure, Consider, Ehrlich, part, of, a, group, of, a, halfdozen, returning, quarterbacks, among, those, to, watch, in, the, area, this, season, That, group, includes, a, trio, of, juniors, Andreans, Scott, Ballentine, Hanover, Centrals, Matt, Koontz, and, Michigan, Citys, Tyler, Bush, and, a, pair, of, seniors, Lowells, Riley, Bank, and, Crown, Points, JJ, Johnson, Ehrlich, has, the, least, seniority, of, those, quarterbacks, But, he, has, already, made, an, impression, on, coach, Craig, Osika, You, see, his, progression, Osika, said, Theres, still, a, lot, of, things, he, needs, to, learn, Its, tough, when, youre, coaching, someone, like, Noah, You, have, to, remember, hes, 15, 16, years, old, Hes, just, a, kid, Noahs, a, pretty, special, player, but, he, still, has, a, lot, to, learn, at, this, level, and, obviously, hes, going, to, be, a, player, at, the, next, level, Hes, staying, grounded, which, is, the, biggest, thing, Hes, doing, a, great, job, of, that, I, talk, to, him, about, becoming, a, leader, Your, sophomore, year, youre, the, quarterback, you, have, to, be, a, coach, on, the, field, Hes, doing, a, good, job, with, that, Everything, were, asking, him, to, do, hes, doing, a, fantastic, job, Ehrlich, has, embraced, the, added, responsibility, I, had, a, big, role, last, year, but, I, was, looking, for, other, people, to, go, off, he, said, This, year, I, feel, like, its, my, turn, to, take, that, role, as, a, leader, They, look, at, me, and, how, I, act, Week, 1, Ill, be, a, lot, less, nervous, than, I, was, last, year, thats, for, sure, Ehrlich, said, he, has, gotten, stronger, and, faster, Hell, be, able, to, scramble, more, if, necessary, after, posting, 16, yards, and, two, TDs, on, 26, carries, last, season, I, know, my, personnel, better, he, said, Just, getting, closer, with, my, teammates, and, coaches, that, helps, with, the, playcalling, Im, on, the, same, wavelength, with, everyone, Ehrlich, has, landed, on, college, radars, He, received, an, offer, from, Miami, of, Ohio, and, he, visited, Toledo, and, West, Virginia, Hes, had, interest, from, the, getgo, said, Osika, a, former, star, at, Hobart, who, played, at, Indiana, and, reached, the, NFL, Any, time, you, have, a, young, kid, getting, interest, at, the, college, level, serious, interest, its, imperative, they, stay, grounded, Ive, had, many, conversations, with, him, and, his, dad, both, Its, very, stressful, I, look, back, to, when, I, went, through, the, recruiting, process, and, that, helps, Obviously, the, recruiting, game, has, changed, completely, from, when, I, did, it, 20plus, years, ago, but, we, have, guys, on, our, staff, who, went, through, the, Division, I, recruiting, process, and, they, can, lean, on, us, and, just, talk, about, the, highs, and, lows, of, it, Just, focus, on, being, the, best, high, school, football, player, you, can, be, right, now, Thats, all, you, can, do, Scott, Ballentine, Also, exhibiting, maturity, beyond, his, years, Ballentine, helped, propel, Andrean, to, the, Class, 2A, state, title, last, season, Its, important, to, understand, that, quarterbacks, in, our, system, hold, a, lot, of, responsibility, Andrean, coach, Chris, Skinner, said, On, every, play, there, are, multiple, options, and, reads, They, must, count, box, defenders, They, set, protection, and, know, the, hot, reads, There, are, postsnap, reads, as, well, Theres, no, margin, for, error, or, else, the, offense, doesnt, work, Scott, was, tasked, with, shouldering, a, revamped, offense, His, knowledge, of, the, game, and, understanding, of, his, responsibilities, were, well, above, average, for, a, sophomore, We, had, three, wide, receivers, with, 50plus, receptions, and, another, three, players, with, 10plus, receptions, Thats, because, a, majority, of, the, time, Scott, was, delivering, the, football, where, it, needed, to, go, based, on, reads, and, progressions, Ballentine, put, up, gaudy, numbers, in, his, first, season, as, a, starter, completing, 222, of, 325, passes, for, 2860, yards, with, 27, TDs, and, eight, interceptions, Skinner, said, Ballentine, has, received, interest, from, Group, of, Five, and, Football, Championship, Subdivision, programs, as, he, enters, his, junior, season, Scott, focused, on, speed, and, strength, development, this, offseason, and, his, hard, work, has, paid, off, Skinner, said, He, improved, his, physical, profile, which, has, opened, up, the, door, to, more, throws, in, the, arsenal, Most, of, the, college, coaches, are, waiting, to, see, how, his, physical, profile, develops, these, next, 12, months, Matt, Koontz, Koontz, also, enjoyed, significant, team, and, individual, success, in, his, first, season, as, a, starter, He, guided, Hanover, Central, to, the, programs, first, sectional, title, Along, the, way, he, completed, 104, of, 181, passes, for, 1891, yards, with, 24, TDs, and, seven, interceptions, and, added, 740, yards, and, 14, TDs, on, 113, carries, Hanover, Central, coach, Brian, Parker, has, seen, Koontzs, progress, Matts, an, extremely, coachable, kid, Parker, said, Hes, been, in, our, system, since, he, was, in, seventh, grade, so, going, into, his, junior, season, this, will, be, his, fifth, year, leading, our, offense, His, ability, to, make, plays, with, both, his, arm, and, his, feet, is, what, makes, him, so, special, Over, the, course, of, the, last, year, hes, grown, by, leaps, and, bounds, in, regards, to, how, he, looks, physically, and, his, ability, to, help, lead, not, only, just, the, offense, but, the, entire, team, Currently, Matt, doesnt, hold, any, offers, but, theres, plenty, of, interest, out, there, Hes, poised, to, have, another, big, season, for, us, and, I, would, think, a, byproduct, of, that, would, equate, to, more, schools, coming, around, and, amping, up, their, interest, Tyler, Bush, Although, he, has, played, less, than, a, full, season, as, Michigan, Citys, starting, quarterback, Bush, already, has, an, offer, from, Kentucky, He, didnt, take, over, until, after, last, season, started, Thensenior, incumbent, Giovani, Laurent, shifted, to, wide, receiver, and, after, making, those, changes, the, Wolves, advanced, to, a, Class, 5A, semistate, Bush, completed, 156, of, 260, passes, for, 2401, yards, with, 23, touchdowns, and, 10, interceptions, Tyler, came, in, with, high, expectations, as, a, sophomore, coach, Phil, Mason, said, He, knew, Gio, was, in, front, of, him, and, that, because, he, was, a, senior, and, returning, starter, he, would, have, a, big, advantage, We, worked, Tyler, in, through, the, first, three, games, and, his, performance, in, the, Chesterton, game, Week, 3, earned, him, the, job, Throwing, for, 2500, yards, and, 20, TDs, through, nine, games, and, leading, us, to, a, semistate, as, a, sophomore, is, a, great, accomplishment, He, still, has, a, lot, of, room, to, grow, We, talk, a, lot, about, technique, reads, rhythm, and, leadership, the, things, that, are, constant, in, becoming, a, great, QB, Hes, very, understanding, of, the, different, things, he, needs, to, do, and, accepts, that, responsibility, He, worked, very, hard, in, the, weight, room, this, offseason, He, knows, he, has, to, become, a, great, leader, as, all, his, receivers, are, new, and, need, him, to, help, them, grow, within, the, offense, With, Jaden, Hart, coming, back, along, with, the, return, of, three, offensive, linemen, the, run, game, will, be, solid, Tyler, knows, he, has, to, develop, trust, and, continuity, with, his, receivers, Riley, Bank, In, Lowells, traditionally, runheavy, offense, Bank, carried, the, ball, more, than, he, threw, it, last, year, He, rushed, for, 1097, yards, and, 14, TDs, on, 169, carries, But, he, provided, the, sectional, champion, Red, Devils, with, a, broader, passing, game, in, his, first, season, as, a, starter, completing, 52, of, 110, for, 652, yards, with, six, TDs, and, four, interceptions, Riley, is, a, toughnosed, kid, who, just, enjoys, playing, the, game, Lowell, coach, Keith, Kilmer, said, Though, he, may, never, have, the, passing, stats, to, earn, top, awards, his, leadership, and, playmaking, skills, make, our, offense, go, His, ability, to, run, the, ball, and, manage, our, offense, gives, us, two, threats, taking, the, heat, off, our, running, back, His, passing, ability, has, progressed, and, we, look, to, be, able, to, utilize, those, skills, more, this, season, JJ, Johnson, Another, dual, threat, Johnson, expects, to, work, with, an, expanded, playbook, in, Craig, Buzeas, second, season, as, coach, Johnson, completed, 90, of, 171, passes, for, 1227, with, 10, touchdowns, and, seven, interceptions, last, season, He, also, had, 647, yards, and, 10, TDs, on, 159, carries,
