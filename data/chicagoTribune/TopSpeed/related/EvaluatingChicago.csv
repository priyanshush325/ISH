Among, the, best, things, the, Chicago, Bears, have, gotten, out, of, this, 310, season, along, with, the, development, of, quarterback, Justin, Fields, is, extended, playing, time, for, a, lot, of, rookies, The, Bears, list, eight, rookies, as, having, started, a, game, and, another, six, on, the, 53man, roster, have, made, varying, impacts, in, all, three, phases, That, time, on, the, field, should, help, Bears, executives, make, evaluations, as, they, plan, for, the, future, and, help, the, players, as, they, try, to, grow, into, building, blocks, It, builds, confidence, defensive, end, Dominique, Robinson, said, I, love, the, staff, They, trust, the, young, guys, to, go, in, there, and, play, There, are, a, bunch, of, us, man, and, its, crazy, Like, Coach, says, were, just, going, to, keep, building, I, think, weve, got, a, bright, future, As, the, Bears, take, this, week, to, reflect, during, their, bye, heres, a, look, at, six, of, their, biggest, rookie, contributors, plus, notes, on, the, other, draft, picks, and, rookies, on, the, active, roster, Note, Stats, are, from, Pro, Football, Reference, The, list, does, not, include, rookies, currently, on, the, practice, squad, Drafted, Second, round, No, 39, Stats, 55, tackles, two, tackles, for, a, loss, one, interception, four, passes, defended, one, forced, fumble, in, 11, games, all, starts, The, rundown, The, Bears, asked, a, lot, of, Gordon, from, the, start, by, assigning, him, to, learn, both, outside, and, nickel, cornerback, His, coaches, were, honest, that, the, mental, load, meant, a, learning, curve, for, the, rookie, and, that, showed, early, in, the, season, But, defensive, coordinator, Alan, Williams, has, pointed, to, growth, in, the, meeting, room, with, the, kinds, of, questions, Gordon, asks, and, in, his, comfort, on, the, field, including, his, ability, to, recognize, plays, and, play, faster, Williams, said, Gordons, tackling, also, has, improved, but, coaches, are, looking, for, better, consistency, Each, week, its, a, little, bit, better, Williams, said, last, month, of, Gordons, growth, When, you, talk, about, rookies, or, firstyear, players, you, have, to, give, them, a, little, bit, of, grace, Not, much, but, a, little, bit, in, terms, of, the, season, for, them, in, college, was, almost, coming, to, an, end, at, that, time, of, year, And, so, its, all, those, things, that, are, stacked, on, top, of, them, Its, not, just, football, Its, the, length, of, the, football, season, Its, the, intensity, of, the, football, season, Its, the, complexity, of, the, NFL, season, Its, the, physical, demands, that, were, putting, on, the, guys, bodies, physical, and, mental, Im, still, pleased, with, Kyler, Gordon, in, a, big, way, One, of, Gordons, biggest, highlights, came, in, the, Bears, last, win, a, 3314, Monday, night, victory, over, the, New, England, Patriots, He, intercepted, Bailey, Zappe, in, the, fourth, quarter, to, put, an, exclamation, point, on, the, win, Gordon, missed, the, last, two, games, while, recovering, from, a, concussion, Hes, getting, more, and, more, comfortable, defensive, backs, coach, James, Rowe, said, You, can, see, him, making, impacts, in, the, games, in, different, ways, I, feel, hes, covering, better, hes, tackling, better, Hes, been, ticking, upward, since, early, in, the, season, Drafted, Second, round, No, 48, Stats, 73, tackles, five, tackles, for, a, loss, three, sacks, three, quarterback, hits, one, interception, one, pass, defended, one, forced, fumble, one, fumble, recovery, in, 11, games, all, starts, The, rundown, Brisker, has, received, the, most, national, recognition, for, his, play, of, all, the, Bears, rookies, His, leaping, interception, of, Mac, Jones, in, the, win, over, the, Patriots, was, among, the, most, exciting, plays, by, a, Bears, defender, this, season, Coach, Matt, Eberflus, has, touted, Briskers, mental, and, physical, toughness, and, his, desire, to, get, better, And, Williams, said, last, week, he, has, seen, growth, in, Briskers, understanding, of, the, details, of, the, defense, though, he, also, missed, the, last, two, games, with, a, concussion, Starting, off, we, all, knew, he, was, physical, and, he, would, hit, and, he, would, run, to, the, ball, Williams, said, Starting, off, it, was, just, that, See, ball, get, ball, Now, Ive, started, to, see, him, getting, to, the, ball, with, a, purpose, within, the, scope, of, the, defense, and, being, on, the, details, and, not, just, running, to, the, football, but, running, to, the, football, within, the, scope, of, the, defense, Some, guys, just, get, lined, up, because, Hey, the, coach, told, me, to, line, up, here, Now, hes, getting, lined, up, and, knowing, the, whys, and, adding, his, little, flair, to, it, Defensive, lineman, Justin, Jones, has, been, impressed, with, how, Brisker, goes, about, his, business, He, said, the, rookie, always, has, his, iPad, with, him, to, study, and, always, is, ready, to, talk, football, Him, and, Jack, Sanborn, both, play, with, a, speed, that, you, dont, really, see, rookies, play, with, when, they, first, come, in, Jones, said, I, know, I, sure, didnt, when, I, came, in, I, saw, it, with, Derwin, James, when, we, both, came, in, as, rookies, together, I, saw, him, play, at, the, same, speed, Now, obviously, Derwin, is, a, little, bit, bigger, Theyre, different, athletes, But, the, mental, part, of, the, game, when, people, say, a, rookie, wall, I, dont, think, hes, had, one, Drafted, Third, round, No, 71, Stats, 11, kickoff, returns, 296, yards, 269, average, five, punt, returns, 35, yards, 70, average, two, fumbles, three, catches, 24, yards, one, touchdown, six, carries, 48, yards, in, eight, games, no, starts, The, rundown, Jones, has, had, perhaps, the, biggest, gap, between, expectation, and, performance, among, the, rookies, He, missed, much, of, training, camp, and, the, first, three, games, with, a, hamstring, injury, Upon, his, recovery, he, muffed, two, punt, returns, in, three, games, and, was, pulled, from, those, duties, He, was, a, healthy, scratch, in, Weeks, 9, and, 10, as, the, Bears, wide, receivers, got, healthier, a, decision, coaches, said, came, down, to, responsibilities, on, both, offense, and, multiple, special, teams, units, But, he, has, been, active, the, last, three, games, With, Khalil, Herbert, on, injured, reserve, with, a, hip, issue, Jones, had, a, 55yard, kickoff, return, against, the, Atlanta, Falcons, and, four, kick, returns, for, 114, yards, against, the, Green, Bay, Packers, Special, teams, coordinator, Richard, Hightower, said, he, saw, Jones, put, in, the, work, to, get, back, to, that, point, Hes, a, guy, that, first, he, takes, accountability, for, everything, Hightower, said, And, then, Ive, seen, a, guy, that, just, works, hard, and, works, his, tail, off, which, means, hes, the, right, kind, of, character, guy, which, is, a, credit, to, the, personnel, staff, that, they, keep, having, guys, in, here, that, have, great, character, Jones, contributions, and, opportunities, on, offense, have, been, limited, with, coaches, pointing, to, him, needing, to, be, on, his, details, Wide, receivers, coach, Tyke, Tolbert, said, the, Bears, had, a, bigger, package, for, Jones, in, the, Packers, game, but, that, resulted, in, only, one, carry, Velus, if, you, asked, me, about, his, progress, two, weeks, ago, three, weeks, ago, I, would, say, hes, doing, OK, Tolbert, said, before, that, game, Ask, me, that, today, I, think, hes, doing, really, well, Velus, has, really, turned, it, up, a, little, bit, in, all, his, stuff, The, trust, is, building, with, Velus, because, hes, where, hes, supposed, to, be, when, hes, supposed, to, be, there, We, had, a, twominute, drill, today, and, he, caught, a, nice, little, swirl, route, from, Justin, Fields, got, a, first, down, Hes, doing, some, good, things, We, just, want, to, keep, him, progressing, Drafted, Fifth, round, No, 168, Stats, Started, all, 13, games, at, left, tackle, five, penalties, three, holding, two, false, starts, five, sacks, allowed, per, Pro, Football, Focus, The, rundown, Jones, is, one, of, the, two, biggest, surprises, of, this, rookie, class, in, that, the, 23yearold, from, Southern, Utah, has, played, every, snap, at, left, tackle, He, and, his, coaches, are, straightforward, in, acknowledging, he, has, plenty, of, improvements, to, make, but, they, also, see, promise, Eberflus, praised, Jones, maturity, and, offensive, line, coach, Chris, Morgan, said, Jones, is, putting, good, things, on, film, but, needs, to, strive, for, more, consistency, Jones, agreed, Im, just, too, up, and, down, he, said, One, week, I, have, a, really, good, week, and, Im, punching, the, guy, and, Im, stoning, him, on, the, line, and, then, the, next, week, Im, in, the, quarterbacks, lap, a, lot, Maybe, Im, not, giving, up, a, ton, of, sacks, but, its, pressures, And, its, just, small, things, like, that, that, can, be, fixed, Thats, the, biggest, thing, is, a, lot, of, my, issues, are, fixable, So, thats, a, good, thing, Jones, has, talked, all, year, about, getting, better, against, bull, rushes, something, he, thinks, can, be, accomplished, by, improving, his, lowerbody, strength, and, his, technique, The, biggest, improvements, he, has, made, he, said, are, moving, in, space, and, not, allowing, one, bad, play, to, carry, over, to, the, next, Thats, not, always, easy, for, a, player, who, said, he, is, super, hard, on, himself, He, just, bounces, right, back, Morgan, said, And, thats, something, you, have, to, learn, sometimes, Im, not, sure, how, much, adversity, he, really, faced, before, on, the, field, He, was, very, dominant, at, his, level, in, college, So, he, has, really, done, a, good, job, of, moving, on, to, that, next, play, Drafted, Fifth, round, No, 174, Stats, 27, tackles, two, tackles, for, a, loss, 1½, sacks, two, quarterback, hits, two, passes, defended, in, 13, games, four, starts, The, rundown, Robinson, made, quite, the, first, impression, in, his, NFL, debut, when, he, had, 1½, sacks, seven, tackles, and, a, tackle, for, a, loss, in, the, opener, against, the, San, Francisco, 49ers, But, he, hasnt, had, a, sack, or, quarterback, hit, since, He, came, in, as, a, stilldeveloping, player, after, switching, to, defensive, end, from, wide, receiver, late, in, his, college, career, at, Miami, Ohio, so, he, sees, the, playing, time, this, season, ranging, from, 30, of, the, defensive, snaps, to, 89, in, different, games, as, huge, for, his, growth, Defensive, line, coach, Travis, Smith, praised, Robinsons, smarts, and, effort, noting, that, when, his, effort, has, been, off, he, takes, accountability, Im, getting, better, Robinson, said, It, may, not, seem, like, that, on, the, field, to, others, but, I, personally, know, that, Im, getting, better, Robinson, has, a, list, of, things, he, has, to, work, on, starting, with, just, being, able, to, fall, back, into, my, other, gap, on, run, defense, The, way, our, defense, is, set, up, we, kind, of, own, two, gaps, so, being, able, to, own, the, other, gap, he, said, Im, doing, all, right, owning, the, first, gap, I, just, have, to, get, better, at, owning, the, second, Pass, rush, Im, trying, to, work, on, being, lower, I, tend, to, get, high, standing, straight, up, and, thats, no, good, in, pass, rush, So, Im, working, at, being, lower, having, a, better, getoff, and, working, off, of, that, Drafted, Signed, with, the, Bears, as, an, undrafted, rookie, Stats, 59, tackles, five, tackles, for, a, loss, two, sacks, three, quarterback, hits, one, fumble, recovery, in, 13, games, five, starts, The, rundown, Sanborn, is, the, other, major, surprise, of, this, class, jumping, in, to, make, a, strong, impact, on, defense, after, the, Bears, traded, linebacker, Roquan, Smith, to, the, Baltimore, Ravens, at, the, end, of, October, The, Lake, Zurich, native, and, Wisconsin, alumnus, often, has, shown, up, with, crucial, plays, during, his, five, games, as, a, starter, Williams, said, Sanborn, has, traits, that, transcend, the, combine, measurables, that, perhaps, held, him, back, from, being, drafted, Eberflus, who, played, linebacker, in, college, and, coached, the, position, at, previous, NFL, stops, said, last, month, it, starts, with, Sanborns, instincts, Hes, able, to, discern, and, read, his, keys, and, be, on, plays, fast, so, thats, very, helpful, to, him, Eberflus, said, Ive, had, linebackers, in, my, career, that, can, really, know, where, the, ball, is, every, time, Theyre, able, to, see, read, the, steps, of, the, back, but, also, see, the, linemen, in, front, of, them, for, the, keys, and, have, their, eyes, move, from, one, spot, to, another, to, diagnose, plays, really, fast, and, he, has, that, ability, He, likes, to, hit, If, youre, a, linebacker, you, have, to, like, that, part, of, the, game, the, physical, style, of, the, game, And, he, also, has, good, ability, to, pressure, He, can, get, oneonone, with, a, back, and, has, the, ability, to, get, slippery, and, slide, to, the, side, to, stay, vertical, in, that, rush, And, hes, smart, Hes, really, smart, really, understands, the, defense, On, top, of, all, of, that, linebackers, coach, Dave, Borgonzi, said, Sanborn, also, has, the, right, mindset, It, never, seemed, too, big, for, him, so, I, never, really, got, that, sense, of, Oh, hes, undrafted, I, dont, know, if, hes, going, to, do, this, Borgonzi, said, Again, thats, just, him, proving, to, us, in, practice, in, the, offseason, that, it, wasnt, too, big, for, him, But, there, are, stories, about, guys, that, go, undrafted, every, year, that, contribute, immediately, I, felt, really, good, going, into, the, season, even, though, he, didnt, have, regularseason, experience,
